# t2ab - text to algorithm breasoning

Text to Algorithm Breasoning is a SWI-Prolog algorithm that prepares to breason out file.txt (in the Text to Breasonings folder) with an algorithm for each word's object.  Breasoning is thinking of the x, y and z dimensions of objects, necessary for meeting grades.

# Getting Started

Please read the following instructions on how to install the project on your computer for breasoning out algorithms.

# Prerequisites

* Please download and install SWI-Prolog for your machine at `https://www.swi-prolog.org/build/`.

# 1. Install manually

Download <a href="http://github.com/luciangreen/t2ab/">this repository</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/luciangreen/listprologinterpreter">List Prolog Interpreter Repository</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/luciangreen/Text-to-Breasonings">Text to Breasonings Repository</a>.

# 2. Or Install from List Prolog Package Manager (LPPM)

* Download the <a href="https://github.com/luciangreen/List-Prolog-Package-Manager">LPPM Repository</a>:

```
mkdir GitHub
cd GitHub/
git clone https://github.com/luciangreen/List-Prolog-Package-Manager.git
cd List-Prolog-Package-Manager
swipl
['lppm'].
lppm_install("luciangreen","t2ab").
../
halt.
```

# Running

* In Shell:
`cd t2ab`
`swipl`
`['t2ab.pl'].`    

* Before running texttobr, think of two radio buttons put on recordings, put through with prayer, nut and bolt, quantum box prayer 1, 1, 0.5 cm and 1, 1, 0.5 cm.

* Follow instructions in https://github.com/luciangreen/Text-to-Breasonings/blob/master/Instructions_for_Using_texttobr(2).pl.txt when using texttoalg, texttobr, or texttobr2 to avoid medical problems.

* Enter the following to breason out object algorithms:
`t2ab(u,u,u,u).`
